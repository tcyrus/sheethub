<hr><h3>Description of The Service</h3>

<p>SheetHub is an integrated online platform that enables content owners to sell and market digital sheet music, score, tablature, and other content to consumers and third-party users. Through our platform, we offer content owners a way to promote, distribute, and monetize their content, and provide consumers with a seamless discovery, community, and marketplace experience.</p>

<hr><h3>Content Rights</h3>

<p>
Our Service is used to sell, distribute and otherwise make available content owned and uploaded by third party rights holders to the SheetHub platform. We developed SheetHub to provide a monetization tool for content owners, and are committed to protecting the rights distributed through our platform. Other than duly licensed content, the copyrights to the material made available and sold through SheetHub are owned by the users who have posted the material. Please note that SheetHub is not paid for, responsible for or involved with the production or distribution of anything made available through our platform. We are paid by content owners for the use of our technology platform, which facilitates the sale of content, and not for content itself.
